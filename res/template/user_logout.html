				<h2>Why do I need to confirm my logout?</h2>
				<p>
					We need you to confirm your action so we can be sure that you
					really requested a logout. If we didn't do this, anyone (or any
					website) would be able to send you to this page and you would
					automatically get logged out of pixeldrain, which would be very
					annoying.
				</p>
				<p>
					To prevent this from happening we're verifying that you actually
					want to log out by making you click this button. Because this
					logout button triggers a different request type than normal
					page visit we can confirm that you really want to log out.
