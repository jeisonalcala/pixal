<details class="api_doc_details request_get">
<summary><span class="method">GET</span>/file/{id}</summary>
<div>

### Description

Returns the full file associated with the ID. Supports byte range requests.

When '?download' is added to the URL the server will send an attachment header
instead of inline rendering, which causes the browser to show a 'Save File'
dialog.

Warning: If a file is using too much bandwidth it can be rate limited. The rate
limit will be enabled if a file has ten times more downloads than views. The
owner of a file can always download it. When a file is rate limited the user
will need to fill out a captcha in order to continue downloading the file. The
captcha will only appear on the file viewer page (pixeldrain.com/u/{id}). Rate
limiting has been added to prevent the spread of viruses and to stop direct
linking.

Pixeldrain also includes a virus scanner. If a virus has been detected in a file
the user will also have to fill in a captcha to download it.

### Parameters

Param    | Required | Location | Description
---------|----------|----------|------------------------------------------
id       | true     | URL      | ID of the file to request
download | false    | URL      | Sends attachment header instead of inline

### Returns

}
```

HTTP 403: Forbidden
```
{
	"success": false,
	"value": "virus_detected_captcha_required",
	"message": "This file has been marked as malware by our scanning systems. To avoid infecting other systems through automated downloads we require you to enter a captcha. The captcha entry is available on the download page"
