	<p>
		Pixeldrain's free tier is supported by my Patrons (be grateful). There's
		only so much that you can do with the budget they provide.
		{formatDataVolume($download_limits.transfer_limit, 3)} per day is about
		the most I can give away for free while keeping it fair for everyone,
		and according to our records you have already downloaded
		{formatDataVolume($download_limits.transfer_limit_used, 3)}.
	</p>
	<p>
		It's not that I want to withold this file from you, it's just that I
		don't want pixeldrain to fall into bankruptcy like so many of the
		websites that came before me. So if you really want this file you have a
		few options:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Come back tomorrow when your free transfer limit resets
		</li>
		<li>
			Download the file at a rate of {file.download_speed_limit/(1<<10)}
			kiB/s. This will take at least
			{formatDuration((file.size/file.download_speed_limit)*1000)}
		</li>
		<li>
			<a href="/#pro" target="_blank" class="button button_highlight">
				<i class="icon">bolt</i> Upgrade your account
			</a>
			and earn my eternal gratitude
			{#if !window.user_authenticated}
				(you will need a <a href="/register">pixeldrain account</a> to
				receive the benefits)
			{/if}
		</li>
	</ul>

<IconBlock icon_href={file.icon_href}>

	Also, I believe you have my stapler. Please give it back.
