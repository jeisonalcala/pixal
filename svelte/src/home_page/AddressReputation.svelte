			<p>
				That these files originated from your IP address does not
				necessarily mean that they were uploaded by you. It's possible
				that people on your home/business network are sharing the same
				IP address. If you're using a VPN then there are often many
				people using the same IP address. And some ISPs deploy CGNAT, in
				which case there could be hundreds of people sharing the same IP
				address. In all of these cases IPv6 is the solution, but most
				ISPs are decades behind on implementing internet standards. They
				just don't care.
			</p>
			<p>
				Now you may be asking: If IP banning is so unreliable, why are
				you still using it? Well, I need to protect my service from
				abuse somehow. The alternative is authenticating every user.
				This adds another barrier to entry and generally complicates
				things.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you would like to dispute your IP ban you can mail me at
				support@pixeldrain.com. Please do not mail unless you have a good
				reason. If you do not provide a valid reason why the IP ban should
				be reversed your e-mail will be ignored. And do not forget to put
				your IP address ({result.address}) in the e-mail.
