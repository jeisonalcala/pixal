<Modal bind:this={file_expiry} title="File Expiry Postponing" padding>
	<p>
		Files on pixeldrain have to expire eventually. If we didn't do this the
		website would keep growing forever and we would run out of money pretty
		quickly.
	</p>
	<p>
		Unlike most other sharing sites pixeldrain uses a postponing system for
		expiring files. When a file is freshly uploaded it gets 120 days by
		default (240 days if you have the pro plan). After these 120 days we
		will check when the file was last viewed. Files which are regularly
		viewed could still bring new users to the platform, it would be rude to
		show these people a File Not Found page. So if the file was viewed in
		the last 120 days we will simply postpone the next check a month. If the
		file was not viewed however it will immediately be removed.
	</p>
	<p>
		Views are only counted when someone visits the download page in a web
		browser. This makes sure that users can see that the file comes from
		pixeldrain.
	</p>
	<p>
		This way we can minimize dead links, and you won't have to tell your
		friends to 'hurry and download this before it expires'.
	</p>
</Modal>

<Modal bind:this={direct_linking} title="Hotlinking Bandwidth" padding>
	<p>
		Paying for bandwidth is the most expensive part of running pixeldrain.
		Because of this we have to limit what can be downloaded and by who.
	</p>
	<p>
		Normally when you view a file it's on pixeldrain's file viewer. The file
		viewer is the page with the download button, the name of the file and a
		frame where you can view the file if it's an image, video, audio, PDF or
		text file.
	</p>
	<h3>Rate limiting</h3>
	<p>
		It's also possible to link directly to a file instead of the download
		page. This circumvents our advertisers and branding and thus we lose
		money when people do this. That's why I added 'hotlink protection mode'
		to files. This mode is enabled when a file has been downloaded five
		times more than it has been viewed through the file viewer. When hotlink
		protection mode is activated a file cannot be downloaded through the
		API, the request needs to come from the file viewer page. On the file
		viewer you will see a CAPTCHA to fill in when you click the download
		button.
	</p>
	<p>
		More information about <a
		href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inline_linking" target="_blank"
		rel="noreferrer">Hotlinking on Wikipedia</a>.
	</p>
	<h3>Hotlinking with a Pro subscription</h3>
	<p>
		When you have a Pro subscription you will get a monthly data transfer
		limit for all the files on your account combined. Files you download
		from pixeldrain are subtracted from the data cap. If you have <a
		href="/user/subscription">Bandwidth sharing</a>
		enabled your data cap is also used when other people download
		your files.
	</p>
	<p>
		In principle there is always someone who pays for the bandwidth usage
		when a file is being downloaded:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			If the person downloading the file has a Pro subscription their data
			cap is used.
		</li>
		<li>
			If the person who uploaded the file has a Pro subscription and
			Bandwidth sharing is enabled on their account, then the uploader's
			data cap is used.
		</li>
		<li>
			If neither the uploader nor the downloader has a Pro subscription
			the download will be supported by advertisements on the download
			page.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		The bandwidth cap on your account is a 30 day rolling window. This means
		that bandwidth usage will expire 30 days after it was used. Your counter
		will not reset at the start of the next month.
	</p>
	<p>
		When a list of files is downloaded with the 'DL all files' button each
		file in the resulting zip file will be counted separately.
	</p>
